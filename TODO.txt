TODO FEATURES
- Added IllegalArgumentException? Should use to check for undefined element, key and values.
- For each collection, replace instantiation code with expandable example code.
  - NativeSet and NativeMap to show their "problem" with using ==. Maybe delete at all? If keep, why not have a NativeArray as well?
